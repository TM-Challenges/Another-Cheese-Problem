            "description": "After a long day of being a goat farmer, Tudor finally returns to an old hobby of his - baking cheese.\n\nTudor's recipe requires N operations to be performed. The operations happen to form a directed tree, where operation ai may depend on some other operations to be performed first. Operation 1 is guaranteed to be the last operation to perform and there will be no cyclic dependencies.\n\nEach operation will generate some intermediate result in the process of baking cheese that needs to be stored in a bowl. When an operation that depends on others to be done first is to be performed, Tudor will take all of the bowls with those intermediate results, grab a new bowl, and mix the intermediate results in the new bowl. After that, the other bowls may be cleaned and reused in later operations.\n\nCompute the minimum number of bowls Tudor needs to bake cheese.",
